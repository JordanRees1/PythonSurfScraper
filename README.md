# Python Surf Scraper
A Python script which can be used to parse MSW for surf reports.

#### How to use
This script is still in development, however it is able to run for a list of URLS from: magicseaweed.com.
The list is comma seperated for example: https://magicseaweed.com/Tynemouth-Longsands-Surf-Report/26/,https://magicseaweed.com/Praia-Da-Areia-Branca-Surf-Report/3784

It is recommended to use this script in a cloud setting / set up to be run on a scheduled basis to get the most of it.

#### Output
An email for each break will be sent to a specified email account.

The script connects to an email server in order to send automatic report updates to a desired email. This must be configured through your email provider. Gmail offers easy access to unauthorised apps and thus is recommended.
